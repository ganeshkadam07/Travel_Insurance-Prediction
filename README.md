# Travel_Insurance-Prediction
Travel Insurance Prediction: This project utilizes machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for estimating the likelihood of a travel insurance claim. By analyzing a range of factors including traveler demographics, trip details, and historical claim data,
Travel Insurance Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of a customer making a travel insurance claim. The model is trained on historical data and can be used to assess the risk associated with providing travel insurance to new customers.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository due to privacy and licensing restrictions. However, a sample dataset can be obtained from [link to the dataset]. The dataset contains information about customers, their travel plans, and whether they made an insurance claim or not.

The dataset should be split into training and testing sets before training the model. It is recommended to use a 70-30 or 80-20 split for training and testing respectively.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

Python 3.7 or higher
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Numpy
You can install the dependencies by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ganeshkadam07/travel-insurance-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd travel-insurance-prediction
Prepare the dataset:

Download the dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets and save them as train.csv and test.csv respectively in the data/ directory.
Train the model:

Copy code
python train.py
This command will train the machine learning model on the training dataset and save the trained model as model.pkl.

Evaluate the model:

Copy code
python evaluate.py
This command will load the trained model and evaluate its performance on the testing dataset, providing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Make predictions:

Copy code
python predict.py
This command will load the trained model and make predictions on a new dataset. The predictions will be saved as a CSV file named predictions.csv in the output/ directory.
